## Architecture

The application is built using a microservices architecture:

- **Frontend**: 
  - Node.js with WebSocket for real-time communication
  - Modern UI with responsive design
  - Client-side message processing and audio handling

- **Backend Services**:
  - Chat Service (gRPC): Handles message routing and translation
  - TTS Service (gRPC): Converts text to speech
  - Auth Service (gRPC): Manages user authentication and profiles

## Prerequisites

- [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) or [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/polychat.git
   cd polychat
   ```

2. Run the setup script to create the conda environment and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   ./setup.sh
   ```

   This script will:
   - Create a conda environment named 'polychat'
   - Install required Python packages
   - Install Node.js dependencies

## Running the Application

1. Start all services:
   ```bash
   ./start.sh
   ```

   This will start:
   - Translation service (port 50051)
   - Chat service (port 50052)
   - Auth service (port 50053)
   - TTS service (port 50054)
   - Frontend server (port 8080)

2. Access the application:
   - Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080

3. Stop all services:
   ```bash
   ./stop.sh
   ```

## Configuration

The application uses configuration files to manage ports and service connections:

- `config/backend_config.json`: Configuration for backend services
- `config/frontend_config.json`: Configuration for frontend server and service connections

You can modify these files to change ports or host settings.

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter any issues with the conda environment, try recreating it:
  ```bash
  ./setup.sh
  ```
  When prompted, choose 'y' to recreate the environment.

- If services fail to start, check the logs for error messages.

- If you need to manually stop a service, use the stop script:
  ```bash
  ./stop.sh
  ```
